# GSpell
An API to access Google Doc's state of the art grammar / spell check 

This repository allows you to use the spelling and grammar checking tool which is provided by Google Docs. I have found it to be much more superior to old school spell checking tools such as SymSpell since it uses LLMs and is thus contextual.
